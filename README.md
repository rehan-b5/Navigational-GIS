## üß† Technical Highlights  

- **Pathfinding Algorithms:**  
  - Implemented **Dijkstra** and **A\*** for optimal route planning across **10+ cities**.  
  - Enhanced performance with heuristics to reduce search complexity.  

- **NP-Hard Problem Solving:**  
  - Tackled the **Travelling Courier problem** using approximation heuristics.  
  - Efficiently computed multi-stop delivery routes.  

- **Custom GIS Features:**  
  - Route visualization with dynamic overlays.  
  - Real-time recalculations when adjusting start, end, or waypoints.  
  - Support for custom user interactions and constraints.  

- **User Interface (GTK/Glade):**  
  - Built an **interactive UI** for intuitive navigation and visualization.  
  - Users can zoom, pan, and toggle between pathfinding options.  
  - Provided instruction screens and easy-to-use controls.

## üìä Features Showcase  

### Core Functionality  
- Load maps from **OpenStreetMap API**.  
- Compute shortest paths between any two points.  
- Generate optimized courier delivery routes.  
- Visualize paths with **real-time updates** in a GTK-based UI.  

### Example User Flow  
1. Load a city map (Toronto, New York, etc).  
2. Select source and destination points.  
3. Choose pathfinding method (**Dijkstra or A***).  
4. View the optimal route drawn dynamically.  
5. For courier mode ‚Üí input delivery points ‚Üí system computes an optimized path.
